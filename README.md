## Prerequisites

### MongoDB

[Installation instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/#mongodb-community-edition-installation-tutorials) for MongoDB across your systems.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run start-api`

Runs the server-api. Will operate on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001). This is where the REST api that communicates with MongoDB lives. **Note:** if you have `nodemon` installed, it will start the server in watch mode; if you do not, it will start the server just using `node`.
